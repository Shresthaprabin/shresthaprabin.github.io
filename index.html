    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Prabin Shrestha, a biostatistician with expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and clinical research.
    With an MS in Biotechnology, a PhD in Biology, and an MS in Biostatistics, along with three years of experience as a data analyst 
    at University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC), Memphis, I bring a strong foundation in biostatistics, molecular biology, 
    and clinical research. My background in handling large-scale healthcare data, applying statistical methodologies, and collaborating 
    on research initiatives aligns well to generate real-world insights in clinical research.
In my current role, I independently lead complex analyses of extensive VA databases, applying advanced statistical techniques to support 
        clinical research initiatives. My expertise in coding, data integration, and statistical modeling enables me to derive meaningful 
        insights from large observational healthcare datasets. I have experience presenting research findings to external collaborators through 
        formal presentations, ensuring clear communication of complex data-driven insights.
With my academic background in biotechnology and biology, I possess a strong understanding of clinical and molecular biology, which allows 
        me to effectively interpret molecular and clinical data. I stay updated on advancements in real-world evidence methodologies, evolving clinical 
        guidelines, ensuring that my analytical approaches remain cutting-edge. Additionally, I have contributed to peer-reviewed publications and 
        conference presentations, demonstrating my commitment to disseminating impactful research.
